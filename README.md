# GeoMap Model Documentation

## Overview
The `GeoMap` model is a sophisticated neural architecture designed to predict well logs from contextual geological data. It leverages a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and deconvolutional networks to process spatial and sequential data effectively. This model is modified Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes, aimed at improving predictions of oil reserves in geospatial tasks with well log measurements.

## Model Architecture
The `GeoMap` model comprises several key components each responsible for a specific aspect of the learning process:

### Encoder
- **Type**: UNet-like architecture.
- **Function**: Extracts and encodes spatial features from the input well logs.
- **Details**: Utilizes convolutional layers to progressively downsample the input, capturing hierarchical features.

### Positional Embedding
- **Type**: 2D Positional Embedding.
- **Function**: Provides the model with information about the relative or absolute position of the samples in the input data.
- **Details**: Generates embeddings that are added to the encoder outputs to maintain spatial awareness in subsequent layers.

### Transformer
- **Type**: Stacked Transformers.
- **Function**: Processes the encoded and embedded input to integrate contextual information across different wells.
- **Details**: Applies self-attention mechanisms to model dependencies without regard to their distance in the input data.

### Fully Connected Series
- **Type**: Series of Linear Layers.
- **Function**: Transforms the output of the transformer into a feature space suitable for generating spatial outputs.
- **Details**: Maps the high-level features derived from the transformer to a space where spatial dimensions can be reconstructed.

### Decoder
- **Type**: Deconvolutional Network.
- **Function**: Up-samples and reconstructs the final output to the desired spatial resolution, predicting well logs.
- **Details**: Uses transpose convolutional layers to progressively upscale the feature maps to the target resolution.

### Activation
- **Type**: Sigmoid.
- **Function**: Normalizes the final output to a range suitable for interpretation as log probabilities or similar metrics.

## Input and Output
- **Input**: 
  - `context`: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_wells, in_channels, depth)` containing the well logs and contextual geological data.
  - `Cx`: Coordinates for positional embeddings, shape `(batch_size, num_wells, 2)`.
- **Output**:
  - A tensor of predicted well logs with shape `(batch_size, output_height, output_width)`.

## Usage
The model can be instantiated and used within a PyTorch training loop or inference pipeline. Ensure that the input tensors are correctly formatted and normalized as required by the model's design.

## Conclusion
The `GeoMap` model is an advanced tool for geospatial data analysis, particularly in the domain of well logging. Its use of CNNs, transformers, and a deconvolutional network allows it to effectively model complex spatial relationships and dependencies in large-scale geological data.
